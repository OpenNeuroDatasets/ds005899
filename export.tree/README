Task description:
The CSST was modified from the standard stop-signal task in order to dissociate proactive control from reactive control processes (Figure 1a) 43,46. Each trial began with a white or green cross (Cue) in the center of the screen for 200 milliseconds, followed by a green arrow (go signal). Participants were demanded to make an accurate and speedy button press in response to the pointing direction of the green arrow. Occasionally, the green arrow turned to red (stop signal), and participants had to withhold their responses when the color changed. The color of the cue indicated the probability of the stop signal in the coming trial. A green cross indicates that no stop signal would occur after the coming go signal, which is defined as Certain Go trial. A white cross indicates that a stop signal may occur after the coming go signal (33% chance), which is defined as Uncertain Go trial. If a stop signal is presented, the trial is defined as Stop trial. The stop-signal delay (SSD) was initialized at 200ms and adjusted in a staircase fashion. If the participant successfully canceled a prepotent response, the SSD increased by 50ms in the next Stop trial. If the participant failed in stopping, the SSD decreased by 50ms in the next Stop trial. Participants completed two runs of the CSST in the scanner, and each run included 32 Certain Go trials, 32 Uncertain Go trials, and 16 Stop trials with jittered inter-trial intervals (ITIs) between 1 and 4 seconds.

Participant information:
The group label is recorded in the participants.tsv file. In the "ADHD" column, a value of 0 indicates typically developing (TD) children, while a value of 1 indicates children with ADHD.

Neuroimaging data:
Functional MRI (fMRI) and structural MRI (sMRI) data are stored in the “openneuro” folder.
